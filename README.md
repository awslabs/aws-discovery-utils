# AWS Discovery Utilities
Utilities for use with the AWS Discovery Service API.
## Export Utility
Using the export.py script, you can collect and organize Discovery data to a specified local location.

## Services

The following services are available as part of the Docker Compose stack.

|Service|Address|
|:------|:------|
|Hadoop|[http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088)|

## Prerequisites

* Docker - [download](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
* Docker Compose - [notes](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup

Clone the repository and then from the cloned directory:

	$ make
	
This will take some time the first time as various Docker images are downloaded.

### Testing

To check all of the containers are running as expected:

	$ docker-compose ps
	
### Cleaning up

Once you've finished

	$ make clean
	
Will shutdown the containers.

### Set up
Before running the export script, make sure you have boto3 installed with `pip install boto3` and have the proper AWS credentials set according to the instructions [here](http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html). Please refer to the boto3 documentation for any related installation issues. 

### Usage 
The script can be called by running `python export.py`. There are several optional command-line arguments you can pass in:
* `--directory [path to directory]` : Path to directory (as string) in which to store the exported data. If no directory is provided, the default is the current working directory. 
* `--start-time [start timestamp]` : The start timestamp from which to start exporting data. If no start timestamp is provided or an agent was registered after the start timestamp, data will be exported starting from registration time. Example format `(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM)`: `2017-05-10T12:00`.
* `--end-time [end timestamp]`: The end timestamp until which data will be exported. If no end timestamp is provided or an agent's last health ping was before the end timestamp, data will be exported until the time of last health ping. Datetime format same as `--start-time`. 
* `--filters [list of agentIds]` : If filters are enabled, discovery data will be exported for only agents with agentIds matching those provided in the list (as strings). If no filters are provided, exports will be run for all agents.
* `--log-file [file name]` : If this option is included, detailed logging of the export process is sent to the named file instead of the console.

### Resulting file structure
After exporting is complete, an 'agentsExports' directory will be created, with subfolders for each agent. Within each subfolder will be more subfolders categorizing exported data by their types (e.g. osInfo, process, systemPerformance, etc.). The "results" subfolder contains metadata about each export task that was run. Inside these subfolders are the exported CSV files, with the start timestamp of the data export as part of the filename.


## Convert CSV Utility
Using the convert_csv.py script, you can convert the CSV output files from export.py to [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files and upload them to the specified S3 bucket. Once in S3, you can create [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) tables using discovery_athena.ddl.

### Set up
This script uses Spark in local mode to convert to Parquet. Install [PySpark](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyspark) with `pip install pyspark`. You may need to update your version of Java. If you get a BindException in initializing SparkContext with "Can't assign requested address" message, then you may need to set environment variable SPARK_LOCAL_IP=127.0.0.1 for proper operation in local mode.

### Usage
Two parameters are required:
* `bucket-name [S3 bucket name]` : Name of the S3 bucket where Parquet files will be written
* `region [AWS region name]` : Region for the named S3 bucket, e.g., us-west-2
Optionally two additional paramters can be specified:
* `--directory [path to directory]` : Path to directory (as string) in which to find the exported CSV data files. If no directory is provided, the default is 'agentExports' from the current working directory.
* `--filters [list of agentIds]` : List of agentIds for which exported data will be converted.

### Creating tables in Athena
Once the Parquet files are in S3, modify the statements in discovery_athena.ddl to reference the correct bucket. Run from the Athena console within a new or existing database, and you should be able to start querying your exported Discovery data.
